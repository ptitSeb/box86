# Installing Wine (and winetricks)
_TwisterOS users: Wine, winetricks, and Box86 are already installed in TwisterOS. You do not have to install anything._

_Raspberry Pi users: Wine requires a 3G/1G split memory kernel. Raspberry Pi OS for the Pi 4 already has a 3G/1G split kernel and works with Wine, but **the Pi 3B+ and earlier models have a 2G/2G kernel and require a custom-compiled 3G/1G kernel to get Wine working.**_

See installation steps below (in the [Examples](#examples) section).

Using Wine with Box86 allows (x86) Windows programs to run on ARM Linux computers (for x64, use [box64](https://github.com/ptitSeb/box64) & wine-amd64 with an `aarch64` processor).

Box86 needs `wine-i386` to be installed **manually** on ARM devices.  Even though `wine-armhf` is available in many repo's on ARM devices (ie using _apt-get_ will attempt to install `wine-armhf` by default), `wine-armhf` will not work with Box86.  Note that manual installation is required since using `multiarch` will result in your ARM device thinking it needs to install lots of i386 dependencies to make `wine-i386` work. The "twist" in Box86 is that Box86 "wraps" many of Wine's core Linux i386 libraries (.so files) so that their calls are interpretable by your ARM device's other armhf Linux system libraries.  Also note that wrapping libraries is an ongoing process throughout Box86 development and that some programs may not run properly until all of their i386 library dependencies are wrapped.

Installation files for Wine can be found in the [WineHQ repository](https://dl.winehq.org/wine-builds/debian/dists/buster/main/binary-i386/), the [TwisterOS FAQ](https://twisteros.com/faq.html) page, or the [PlayOnLinux website repository](https://www.playonlinux.com/wine/). Box86 requires the "i386" (x86) version of Wine even though we are installing it on an ARM processor.

## Overview
The general procedure for installing Wine for Box86 is to...
 - Download all the install files (.deb, .zip, or even .pol files) for the version of Wine you wish to install
 - Unzip or dpkg the install files into one folder
 - Move that folder to the directory that you wish Wine to run from (in TwisterOS, this is `~/wine/` by default)
 - If you are running box86/i386-wine on a 64bit ARM OS (aarch64), you will also have to install some extra armhf libraries.
 - Go to `/usr/local/bin` and make symlinks or scripts that will point to your main wine binaries (`wine`, `winecfg`, and `wineserver`).
 - Boot wine to create a new wineprefix (`wine wineboot`).
 - Download winetricks (which is simply a very complicated bash script), make it executable, then copy it to `/usr/local/bin`.

## Examples
### Installing Wine for Box86 on Raspberry Pi OS from Twister OS FAQ .tgz files
_Links from the [TwisterOS FAQ](https://twisteros.com/faq.html)_

This installs Wine v5.13 (which is the version of Wine that comes pre-installed in TwisterOS).  When submitting bug reports, other Box86 users may assume you are using this version of Wine unless you specify otherwise.

## Installing winetricks
Winetricks is a bash script which makes it easier to install & configure any desired Windows core system software packages which may be dependencies for certain Windows programs.  You can either install it with `apt`, or manually using the steps below.

```
sudo apt-get install cabextract -y                                                                   # winetricks needs this installed
sudo mv /usr/local/bin/winetricks /usr/local/bin/winetricks-old                                      # Backup old winetricks
cd ~/Downloads && wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Winetricks/winetricks/master/src/winetricks # Download
sudo chmod +x winetricks && sudo mv winetricks /usr/local/bin/                                       # Install
```

Whenever we run winetricks, we must tell Box86 to supress its info banner, otherwise winetricks will crash.  Box86's info banner can be suppressed using the `BOX86_NOBANNER=1` environment variable before invoking winetricks (example: `BOX86_NOBANNER=1 winetricks`).

If `apt` installed a desktop menu shortcut for winetricks (or if you make your own desktop shortcut for winetricks) then you may need to edit that shortcut to include Box86's BOX86_NOBANNER=1 env var.  With your favorite text editor, edit `/usr/share/applications/winetricks.desktop` and change `Exec=winetricks --gui` to `Exec=env BOX86_NOBANNER=1 winetricks --gui`.

## Example commands
Here is an example of how we should run a winetricks command with box86:  
`BOX86_NOBANNER=1 winetricks -q corefonts vcrun2010 dotnet20sp1`  
_This command will silently install three packages in series: Windows core fonts, VC++ 2010 Runtimes, and .NET 2.0 SP1.  `-q` is the "install silent/quiet" command._

Whenever we run winetricks, we must suppress Box86's banner by typing `BOX86_NOBANNER=1` to prevent winetricks from crashing.  Invoking Box86's logging features (with `BOX86_LOG=1` or similar) will also cause winetricks to crash.  (If Box86 logging is necessary though, we can patch winetricks to avoid these crashes - see the *Troubleshooting* section) # future work.

For a list of all the different Windows packages & libraries that winetricks can help you install, run `winetricks list-all`  

## Other notes

### Wineprefixes (and Wine initialization)
When you first run or boot Wine (`wine wineboot`), Wine will create a new user environment within which to install Windows software.  This user environment is called a "wineprefix" (or "wine bottle") and is located (by default) in `~/.wine` (note that Linux folders with a `.` in front of them are "hidden" folders).  Think of a wineprefix as Wine's virtual 'harddrive' where it installs software and saves settings.  Wineprefixes are portable and deletable.  For more Wine documentation, see [WineHQ](https://www.winehq.org/documentation).

If you at any point corrupt something inside your default wineprefix, you can start "fresh" by deleting your `~/.wine` directory (with the `rm -rf ~/.wine` command) and boot wine again to create a new default wineprefix.

### Transplanting wineprefixes (side-loading)
If software isn't installing in Wine with Box86, but is installing for you in Wine on a regular x86 Linux computer, you can copy a wineprefix from your x86 Linux computer to the device you're running Box86 on. This is most easily done by tarring the `~/.wine` folder on your x86 Linux computer (`tar -cvf winebottle.tar ~/.wine`), transferring the tar file to your device, then un-tarring the tar file (`tar -xf winebottle.tar`) on your device running Box86 & Wine. Tarring the wineprefix preserves any symlinks that are inside it.

### Swapping out different versions of Wine
Some versions of Wine work better with certain software. It is best to install a version of Wine that is known to work with the software you would like to run. There are three main development branches of Wine you can pick from, referred to as wine-stable, wine-devel, and wine-staging. _Note that the wine-staging branch requires extra installation steps on Raspberry Pi._

Your entire Wine installation can reside within a single folder on your Linux computer. TwisterOS assumes that your Wine installation is located inside the `~/wine/` directory. The actual directory where you put your `wine` folder doesn't matter as long as you have symlinks within the `/usr/local/bin/` directory which point to the `wine` folder so that Linux can find Wine when you type `wine` into the terminal).

You can change which version of Wine you are running simply by renaming your old `wine` and `.wine` folders to something else, then putting a new `wine` folder (containing your new version of Wine) in its place. Running `wine wineboot` again will migrate a wineprefix from an older version of Wine to be usable by the newer version of Wine you just installed.  You can check which version of Wine you're running with the `wine --version` command.
