 PreLoaded libs can be emulated or native, and are treated the same way as if they were comming from the binary (not that using this inside a rcfile might not work if the process needs to be renamed, for example for Wine process)
 
#### BOX86_EMULATED_LIBS *

#### BOX86_NOVULKAN *
Disables the load of vulkan libraries.
 * 0 : Load vulkan libraries if found.
 * 1 : Disables the load of vulkan libraries, both the native and the i386 version (can be useful on Pi4, where the vulkan driver is not quite there yet.)

 will add XXX=yyyy env. var.

#### BOX86_ENV1

#### BOX86_SHOWSEGV *
Show Segfault signal even if a signal handler is present
 * 0 : Don't force segfault details when a signal handler is install (Default, to limit message spamming)
 * 1 : Show segfault details

#### BOX86_SHOWBT *

 * 1 : Show native backtrace when a signal is dumped (not available on Andoid build)

#### BOX86_BASH *
Define x86 bash to launch script
 * yyyy
Will use yyyy as x86 bash to launch script. yyyy needs to be a full path to a valid x86 version of bash. Note that is Box64 is available, an x86_64 version of bash can also be used. Also, BOX64_BASH env. var. will also be read if BOX86_BASH is not defined.

#### BOX86_BOX64
Define where to find box64 binary
 * yyyy
Will use yyyy as x86_64 interpretor, to launch x64_64 binaries

#### BOX86_JITGDB *

 * 0 : Just print the Segfault message on segfault (default)
 * 1 : Launch `gdb` when a segfault, bus error or illegal instruction signal is trapped, attached to the offending process and go in an endless loop, waiting.
 When in gdb, you need to find the correct thread yourself (the one with `my_box86signalhandler` in is stack)
 then probably need to `finish` 1 or 2 functions (inside `usleep(..)`) and then you'll be in `my_box86signalhandler`, 
 just before the printf of the Segfault message. Then simply 
 `set waiting=0` to exit the infinite loop.
 * 2 : Launch `gdbserver` when a segfault, bus error or illegal instruction signal is trapped, attached to the offending process, and go in an endless loop, waiting.
 Use `gdb /PATH/TO/box86` and then `target remote 127.0.0.1:1234` to connect to the gdbserver (or use actual IP if not on the machine). After that, the procedure is the same as with ` BOX86_JITGDB=1`.
 This mode can be usefullwhen programs redirect all console output to a file (like Unity3D Games)
 * 3 : Launch `lldb` when a segfault, bus error or illegal instruction signal is trapped, attached to the offending process and go in an endless loop, waiting.

#### BOX86_NORCFILES
If the env var exist, no rc files (like /etc/box86.box86rc and ~/.box86rc) will be loaded

#### BOX86_NOSANDBOX
 * 0 : Nothing special
 * 1 : Added "--no-sandbox" to command line arguments (usefull for chrome based programs)
