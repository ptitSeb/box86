Compiling/Installing
----

#### Debian-based Linux 
You can use the [Pi-Apps-Coders apt repository](https://github.com/Pi-Apps-Coders/box86-debs) to install precompiled box86 debs, updated every 24 hours. 

```
# check if .list file already exists
if [ -f /etc/apt/sources.list.d/box86.list ]; then
  sudo rm -f /etc/apt/sources.list.d/box86.list || exit 1
fi
# check if .sources file already exists
if [ -f /etc/apt/sources.list.d/box86.sources ]; then
  sudo rm -f /etc/apt/sources.list.d/box86.sources || exit 1
fi
# download gpg key from specified url
if [ -f /usr/share/keyrings/box86-archive-keyring.gpg ]; then
  sudo rm -f /usr/share/keyrings/box86-archive-keyring.gpg
fi
sudo mkdir -p /usr/share/keyrings
wget -qO- "https://pi-apps-coders.github.io/box86-debs/KEY.gpg" | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/box86-archive-keyring.gpg
# create .sources file
echo "Types: deb
URIs: https://Pi-Apps-Coders.github.io/box86-debs/debian
Suites: ./
Signed-By: /usr/share/keyrings/box86-archive-keyring.gpg" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/box86.sources >/dev/null
```

On a 32bit OS, run the following additional commands
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install box86-generic-arm -y
```

On a 64bit OS, run the following additional commands
```
sudo dpkg --add-architecture armhf
sudo apt update
sudo apt install box86-generic-arm:armhf -y
```

Alternatively, you can generate your own package using the [instructions below](https://github.com/ptitSeb/box86/blob/master/docs/COMPILE.md#debian-packaging). 

#### for Pandora

 `mkdir build; cd build; cmake .. -DPANDORA=1 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo; make`

#### for Pyra

 `mkdir build; cd build; cmake .. -DPYRA=1 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo; make`

#### for Gameshell

`mkdir build; cd build; cmake .. -DGAMESHELL=1 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo; make`

#### for Raspberry Pi

 _A build for model 2, 3 and 4 can be done. Model 1 and 0 cannot (at least not with Dynarec, as they lack NEON support)_
 
```
git clone https://github.com/ptitSeb/box86
cd box86
mkdir build; cd build; cmake .. -DRPI4=1 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo # -DRPI4=1 for Pi4 (use `-DRPI2=1` etc for other models)
make # can use `make -j2`, `make -j3`, etc to speed up 1st build (but beware of running out of memory if going too high)
sudo make install
sudo systemctl restart systemd-binfmt
```
 
#### for Raspberry Pi on 64bit OS

_armhf multiarch or chroot required for running box86 (armhf) on aarch64_

```
# example of enabling multiarch & installing libc6:armhf (to run box86:armhf on aarch64)
#  (running i386-wine on aarch64 requires more armhf libraries)
sudo dpkg --add-architecture armhf && sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libc6:armhf -y
```
_Build box86:armhf on RPiOS 64-bit ARM (aarch64)_
```
sudo apt install gcc-arm-linux-gnueabihf # building 32-bit ARM code on aarch64 requires this armhf gcc cross-compiler toolchain 
git clone https://github.com/ptitSeb/box86
cd box86
mkdir build; cd build; cmake .. -DRPI4ARM64=1 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo # -DRPI4ARM64=1 for Pi4 aarch64 (use `-DRPI3ARM64=1` for a PI3 model)
make -j2

You can also add `-DBAD_SIGNAL=ON` to the cmake command if you are on Linux Kernel mixed with Android, like on RK3588 or maybe Termux

You'll need an `armhf` multiarch environment, and an armhf gcc: On debian, install it with `sudo apt install gcc-arm-linux-gnueabihf`. 

Also, on armbian, you may need to install `libc6-dev-armhf-cross` or you may have an issue with `crt1.o` and a few other files not included with box86.

#### for Other ARM Linux platforms

 `mkdir build; cd build; cmake .. -DARM_DYNAREC=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo; make -j3`

You can also add `-DBAD_SIGNAL=ON` to the cmake command if you are on Linux Kernel mixed with Android, like on RK3588 or maybe Termux

#### for x86 Linux

 `mkdir build; cd build; cmake .. -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS="-m32" -DLD80BITS=1 -DNOALIGN=1 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo; make -j3`

### use ccmake

Alternatively, you can use the curses-bases ccmake (or any other gui frontend for cmake) to select wich platform to use interactively.

### Customize your build

#### use ccache if you have it

Add `-DUSE_CCACHE=1` if you have ccache (it's better if you plan to touch the sources)

#### To have some debug info

The `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo` argument makes a build that is both optimized for speed, and has debug information embedded. That way, if you have a crash or try to analyse performance, you'll have some symbols.

#### To have a Trace Enabled build

To have a trace enabled build (***the interpreter will be slightly slower***), add `-DHAVE_TRACE=1`. But you will need the [Zydis library](https://github.com/zyantific/zydis) in your `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` or in the system library folders at runtime.

#### to have ARM Dynarec

###### *Note: VFPv3 and NEON are required for Dynarec.*
###### You might need to `sudo apt install neon-support` package for CMAKE to correctly detect them.

###### *Note: Compiling with `ARM_DYNAREC` without selecting a hardware profile is not advised.*

Dynarec is only available on the ARM architecture (for the meantime anyways). Activate it by using `-DARM_DYNAREC=1`.

You will most likely need `-marm` in compilation flags (Many compilers default to the Thumb instruction set and Dynarec does not support this).

###### *Note: If you get error building that "target CPU does not support ARM mode", then try to pick a hardware profile (like ODROIDXU4 for armv7 or PI4 for armv8).*

##### 64bit OS with Dynarec

If you are using a 64bit OS with armhf multiarch, it's much easier to pick one of the hardware profiles.

`RPI4ARM64`, `RK3399`, `PHYTIUM` or `SD845`.

#### Not building from a git clone
If you are not building from a git clone (for example, downloading a release source code zip from github), you need to use `-DNOGIT=1` from cmake to be able to build (box86 uses git SHA1 to show last commit in version number).

----

Testing
----
A few tests are included with box86.

They can be launched using the `ctest` command.

The tests are very basic and only tests some functionality for now.

----

Note about devices with Tegra X1 and newer.

NVIDIA doesn't provide armhf libraries for their GPU drivers at this time. There is no special variable to compile box86 for them, as it would be misleading to many people. If you still want to use it wihout GPU acceleration, building it with RPI4 configuration should work just fine. Installation of Mesa can break the NVIDIA driver, so the safest option is to use a chroot environment.

----

Debian Packaging
----
Box86 can also be packaged into a .deb file ***using the source code zip from the releases page*** with `DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=nostrip dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc -nc`. Configure any additional cmake options you might want in `debian/rules`.
